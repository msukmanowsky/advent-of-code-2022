# Advent of Code 2022

For 2022's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/), I decided to put
Python to the side and try to learn a little bit of [Go](https://go.dev/)!

My hope was that in completing these exercises, I'd start to get a feel for
what "idiomatic Go" means.

# Running the Challenges

The basic format is `go run main.go <subcommand>` (e.g. `go run main.go day1`).

Here are the relevant commands for different days:

| Day | Commands                                                           |
|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | `go run main.go day1`                                              |
| 2   | Part 1: `go run main.go day2.1`<br>Part 2: `go run main.go day2.2` |
| 3   | Part 1: `go run main.go day3.1`<br>Part 2: `go run main.go day3.2` |
| 4   | Part 1: `go run main.go day4.1`<br>Part 2: `go run main.go day4.2` |
| 5   | Part 1: `go run main.go day5.1`<br>Part 2: `go run main.go day5.2` |
